## 1.1.1 Background
A local skateboard shop (Beans and Boards) have a loyal customer base that use the shop for their point of contact for all things skateboarding related. “Is the park dry?” Is a common question that the shop owners receive on a regular bases. With a designated website to update customers on the weather conditions at the local skatepark this enables customers to check on the park if the shop isn’t available to answer. As an added benefit, this will also allow the shop to publicise an added service to their customers.

## 1.1.2 Wire frames
Below are wireframes for each page of the website. For the purpose of these wire frames the mobile and desktop screens have been stretched in height to display the whole design of each page.

## 1.1.3 Colour Choices
As the shop has a current website for their products the choice of colours will be to match the existing website. This will allow for continuity between the sites and give customers a seamless change from one to the other. The existing beans and board website current uses a minimalist look, using yellow, white and light greys. Being a weather site, these colour will be incorporated well. To differentiate between the two sites, blue has been added to the weather site to incorporate the sense of the sky.

## 1.1.4 Accessibility
After looking at the W3C guidelines regarding the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines [WCAG2](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/) requirements. I have ensured that the website meets the specification where necessary. Examples of these modifications can be seen below:

## 1.1.5 GDPR
In order to conform with General Data Protection Regulations a privacy policy has been created and is possible to be access from the footer of every page of the website site. As the site will be closely affiliated with the beans and boards shop website, a link has been added onto the sites privacy page that will allow visitors to access their privacy policy also. As the site is displaying information rather than gathering information from the end user, this reduces the chance for a break in data protection. 

## 1.1.6 Distance Selling
In 2014 the legislation regarding Distance Selling Regulations were replaced be the Consumer Contracts Regulations. There are requirements set out by the regulation, these apply to any website selling goods. As this website is not selling a product this will not apply. As mentioned in 1.1.5, as the site is closely affiliated with the web shop, another link has been added to the privacy page to redirect to the beans and boards terms and conditions. I have also checked the web shop to which they do comply with the relevant Consumer Contracts Regulations.
